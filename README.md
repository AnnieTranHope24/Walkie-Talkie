The Walkie Talkie Chat App is a dynamic communication platform developed using Flutter and SpringBoot. 
After creating an account, users can sign in, add contacts, and start to chat with their contacts.
They can change their user information from the settings page.
The main page once the user signs in displays the most recent conversations of that user with others.
